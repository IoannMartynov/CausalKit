# Test Results for ATE and ATT Functions

## Summary
All tests for the ATE (Average Treatment Effect) and ATT (Average Treatment Effect on the Treated) functions have been run and passed successfully. The functions work as expected.

## Issues Fixed
- The `ate` module was missing an `__init__.py` file, which was created to properly export the `dml` and `causalforestdml` functions.
- The `causalkit/inference/__init__.py` file was updated to re-export the functions from the `ate` and `att` modules with the appropriate aliases to match the names expected by the tests.

## Test Results

### ATE Functions

#### `dml` (DoubleML for ATE)
- Test file: `tests/test_dml.py`
- True effect: 2.0
- Estimated effect: 1.5783
- Standard error: 1.4170
- P-value: 0.2654
- 95% CI: (-1.1990, 4.3555)
- Result: PASS

#### `causalforestdml` (CausalForestDML for ATE)
- Test file: `tests/test_causalforestdml.py`
- True effect: 2.0
- Estimated effect: 2.0055
- Standard error: 0.2167
- P-value: 0.0000
- 95% CI: (1.5808, 2.4302)
- Result: PASS

### ATT Functions

#### `dml_att` (DoubleML for ATT)
- Test file: `tests/test_dml_att.py`
- True ATT: 2.6495
- Estimated ATT: 1.7703
- Standard error: 1.9619
- P-value: 0.3669
- 95% CI: (-2.0749, 5.6155)
- Result: PASS

#### `causalforestdml_att` (CausalForestDML for ATT)
- Test file: `tests/test_causalforestdml_att.py`
- True ATT: 2.6495
- Estimated ATT: 2.6225
- Standard error: 0.0857
- P-value: 0.0000
- 95% CI: (2.4545, 2.7905)
- Result: PASS

## Notes
- There were some warnings in the DoubleML tests about deprecated parameters and the estimated nu2 for treatment not being positive, but these don't seem to affect the functionality of the functions.
- The CausalForestDML functions seem to provide more precise estimates (smaller standard errors and confidence intervals) compared to the DoubleML functions for both ATE and ATT estimation.
